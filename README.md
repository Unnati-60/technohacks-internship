A theme switch toggles between light and dark modes for visual customization. While lacking advanced features like parentheses support, it serves as a simple tool for basic calculations. The interface includes input handling, display animations, and responsive design for usability across devices. heres the [video](https://github.com/Unnati-60/technohacks-internship/blob/main/Basic-Calculator-using-HTML-CSS-JS/calculator_.mp4)

Basic validation ensures positive input.heres the [video](https://github.com/Unnati-60/technohacks-internship/blob/main/Currency%20Converter/currency-converter_.mp4)

# TASK 3: Login Page
This login page, developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offers user input validation for email and password fields. The CSS imports the Google Fonts library to style text with the "Poppins" font. All elements are reset with margin, padding, and box-sizing properties for consistent layout. The "Poppins" font is applied globally for a modern and readable interface. While providing basic security measures, further enhancements could include backend integration for user authentication and data encryption.heres the [video](https://github.com/Unnati-60/technohacks-internship/blob/main/Login-Page-using-html-css/login-page_.mp4)
